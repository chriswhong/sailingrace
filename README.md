KMZ track of a sailboat race, with 3D model sailboat

This was a for-fun project.  A co-worker challenged the company to "do something fun" with the breadcrumb data he was collecting during a sailing race.  (He was actually sending it to the cloud in real-time, but I thought a recap of the trip in Google Earth would be more fun and make a great video)

You can play this kmz trip in Google Earth, or watch the video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K4_jTfO5CA&feature=c4-overview&list=UUpHtwgRedEGQz_1dm3jbi6w
